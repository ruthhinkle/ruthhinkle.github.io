    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I tell compelling stories to change hearts, minds, and habits. I collaborate with clients to tease out essential stories. I prioritize clear and accessible language to break down complex ideas to their basics. I'm currently studying data visualization at Northwestern University to use data to tell stories and drive impact.</p>
    <p>I have a human-centered approach. Being able to meet people where they are was essential in my roles as a community organizer, volunteer manager, and fundraiser. I break down projects and goals into realistic milestones and support people to uncover obstacles and move beyond them.</p>
